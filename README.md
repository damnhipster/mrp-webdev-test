# Mr Porter Web Dev Test

## Task

* Build a dynamic product listing page using the API
* Ensure its layout adapts to mobile/desktop viewports
* Ensure product images look sharp on retina devices
* Implement pagination/infinite scroll
* Use any library/framework you deem applicable
* Don't worry about header/footer

Use the following [design mockups](public/mockups.jpg).

This is a chance for you to show us how you think this part of our website should be built. The task
should take about 2 hours but it's more important you're happy with your implementation than to
finish bang on time.


## Setup

To run the app:

```shell
$ npm install
$ node app
```

    }, ...]
}
